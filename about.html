        <p>Traditional art is art that is part of a culture of a certain group of people, with skills and knowledge passed down through generations from masters to apprentices. But on my “art world”, the academic environment, when we speak of Traditional Art, we are often referring to what we call Classical Art: the ideas that emerged from the Renaissance and Illuminism about what art should represent to society. These ideas emerged on the Renaissance, but lasted long after, until the 19th century. and these ideas and concepts are directly connected to Academicism. Academicism is the method of professionalizing art education, designed, formalized and taught by European art academies, starting on the 16th Century. There is in the academicism the appreciation of renowned masters, veneration of the classical tradition, and the adoption of concepts collectively formulated, that had, besides a aesthetic character, also ethical origins and purposes. And it is about these concepts that I propose to speak. At least, the concepts that I understand, and believe in. But, in short, the term Classical Art refers to, basically, all kinds of art that existed before Modern Art, before the Modernist Movement.</p><br>
